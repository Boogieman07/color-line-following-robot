# color-line-following-robot
For this simulation I have used ROS Noetic and Rviz Simulation . The Bot( Turtlebot waffle Pi) is capable of detecting the colored line(yellow) and can move along the path.
simulations used :
                   -> ROS - Noetic
                   -> Rviz
                   -> Visual Code
                   -> Gazebo
Required Package : Turtlebot3 package
Bot name : TURTLEBOT , Model : WAFFLE PI
