# color-line-following-robot
I utilized ROS Noetic and Rviz Simulation to develop this simulation. The robot, named TURTLEBOT and based on the WAFFLE PI model, is designed to detect a colored line (specifically, yellow) and navigate along the path. The simulation was created using a combination of tools including ROS - Noetic, Rviz, Visual Code, and Gazebo. To execute the simulation successfully, the Turtlebot3 package is required.


#Required Software:
 ROS - Noetic
 Rviz
 Gazebo
#Required Package:
 Turtlebot3
 
To run this simulation, make sure you have the following software and package installed on your system. ROS - Noetic provides the core framework for robotic applications, while Rviz and Gazebo offer visualization and simulation capabilities. Additionally, the Turtlebot3 package is necessary for running the specific robot model used in this simulation.
